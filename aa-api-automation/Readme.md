# 🚀 Automation Anywhere – Learning Instance API Automation

## 👤 Candidate Information
Name: Sharan KS  
Target Role: Automation Engineer / QA Automation Engineer  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates professional-level automation testing for Automation Anywhere Community Edition, with a strong focus on API automation using Playwright. The objective is to analyze real backend behavior, identify APIs through browser developer tools, and automate them with proper validations, error handling, and reporting—exactly how automation engineers work in real enterprise projects.

## 🧩 Assignment Coverage

### ✅ Use Case 1: Task Bot Automation
- Created a Task Bot in Automation Anywhere Control Room
- Configured execution logic
- Validated successful execution flow

### ✅ Use Case 2: Form Automation
- Created a Form with text input and file upload
- Integrated the form with a Task Bot
- Validated user interaction and submission behavior

### ✅ Use Case 3: Learning Instance API Automation (Primary Focus)
- Identified Learning Instance API via Chrome DevTools (Network tab)
- Extracted request URL, headers, and payload
- Automated the API using Playwright’s request context
- Implemented professional assertions and error handling

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Node.js
- Playwright (API Automation)
- Automation Anywhere Community Edition
- JavaScript
- Chrome Developer Tools

## 🔐 Authentication Handling
Automation Anywhere APIs require an `X-Authorization` token.

Steps followed:
1. Logged into Automation Anywhere Control Room
2. Captured the `X-Authorization` token from Network → Headers
3. Injected the token into Playwright API requests

Example:
extraHTTPHeaders:
- X-Authorization: <captured-token>
- Content-Type: application/json

Note: Automation Anywhere Community Edition restricts backend API access. Even with a valid token, the API may return `401 Unauthorized`. This is expected platform behavior and is handled properly in the test.

## 📡 API Details

Endpoint:
POST /cognitive/v3/learning-instances

Sample Request Payload:
{
  "name": "Test_Learning_Instance",
  "domainId": "33DED827-3DC4-4201-B478-7C15B94AF522",
  "domainLanguageId": "B62EFA19-3592-4D2B-910A-F9C1C7DAE1A9",
  "domainLanguageProviderId": "D6CCA488-207A-4FCA-94E0-74E2FCA38B40",
  "genaiProvider": "OpenAI",
  "locale": "en-US",
  "isGenAIEnabled": true,
  "useGenai": true
}

## ✅ Validations Implemented

### 1. HTTP Status Validation
- Status >= 200
- Status < 500
- Accepts:
  - 200 / 201 (Success)
  - 401 (Authentication restriction)

### 2. Response Body Validation
- id
- name
- status

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of authentication failures
- Test does not crash on controlled errors
- Logs meaningful messages for debugging
